Documentation     Include Authorized tradelines by configuration
...
...               Description:
...
...               Authorized tradelines are tradelines that are listed on an individuals credit report because they are authorized to use the credit line, but the individual is not financially responsible for payment on the account. \ A common example is a company card or a spouse added to an existing tradeline. \ Some lenders will want to count these tradelines while others will not. \ As an administrator, I want to be able to define whether or not authorized tradelines should be counted in calculations and ratios.
...
...
...               New section under DMS settings:
...               " Summary information"
...
...               New configuration in this section:
...               When calculating summary information and ratios, trade lines that are listed as "Authorized User" should: \ be INCLUDED in the summary informaiton, NOT be included in the summary information.
...
...               Default to not include.
...
...               When set to not include, the summary information should exclude Authorized user tradelines.
...
...               Authorized users are determined by the ECOA codes as follows:
...
...               EFX \ DMS ECOA \ Text
...               A \ A \ Authorized User â€“ This is an authorized user of this account; another individual has contractual responsibility.
...
...
...               TU Code \ DMS ECOA \ Text
...
...
...
...               A \ A \ Authorized spouse user: joint account in which either spouse is an authorized user, but has no joint contractual liability .
...
...
...               XPN Code \ DMS Code \ Type \ \ Description

...
...               3 \ A \ Authorized User \ This individual is an authorized user of this account; another individual has contractual responsibility.
